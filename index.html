                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Trail Angel is an idea my team and I developed when we began discussing our hobbies, and learned
                        our common love of hiking but not going as often as we would like either due to safety concerns
                        of going alone, or by not having someone to go with.
                        As women who love hiking but often fear going alone for safety reasons, we all personally would
                        enjoy having an app around to help ease that anxiety.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>We are developing an app for women who love hiking. Our app allows users to find other female
                        hiking companions, monitor crime data for specific hiking locations, and find other specific
                        safety information in one central location. The app is designed to help women feel safer while
                        hiking.

                    <h3>Reseach</h3>
                    <p>We had an idea based on our experiences, but first steps are to understand if a hiking safety
                        companion is something that other women or people would want, and if it is even common for women
                        to
                        have reservations when hiking alone. We needed a better understanding of this market to move
                        forward, and to learn what features would be beneficial.
                        <br>
                        Before diving into this research, we created a research plan to define what the research goals
                        were,
                        and how to go about getting the right information to move forward.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Market Reaearch</h3>
                    <p>We began with market research by creating a survey that we distributed to hikers of all genders,
                        although receiving mostly female responses. This was used to understand what, if anything was
                        affecting the frequency of going for a hike. Additionally, if there were safety concerns when
                        going
                        alone.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The survey was distributed online and through hiking Facebook groups. We received 51 total
                            responses. Of this, 26 specified their gender with 25 females and 1 non-conforming. </li>
                        <li>All participants said they enjoy hiking, with 38 saying that they either go monthly or
                            "sometimes"</li>
                        <li>66% of all participants said they prefer hiking with a group. When asked why, 47 people
                            replied,
                            of which 36% stated safety concerns.</li>
                        <li>84.3% of all participants said they would go more often if they always had someone to go
                            with
                        </li>
                        <li>54.9% of all participants said that they do research the safety of a location before a hike.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <p> After conducting market research, we began analyzing existing products on the market to
                        determine their strengths and weaknesses We narrowed competitors to six that are top in the
                        market and that solve similar problems ranging from safety to social networking. Through
                        competitor analysis, we were able to understand different approaches that companies were taking
                        and develop ways to make Trail Angel stand out and also determine best decision to take. We saw
                        the most opportunity with merging a way to see safety risks quickly and easily in the hiking
                        area and also connecting female hikers to help ease any anxiety.

                    <h3>User Intervews</h3>
                    <p>After gaining a better understanding through surveys, and through researching competitors, we
                        began conducting user interviews to get direct insight into the thoughts and experiences of our
                        potential users and what would make users feel safe when doing on hikes?
                        <br>
                        Six people chosen to be interviewed. Four female, and two male so we could stay true to our
                        primary demographic, but also gain insight on whether women should be the only target audience.
                        To create a more efficient and thorough interview process, I decided to have us conduct initial
                        interviews together, where I would be the interviewer, Mikki would take notes, and Cassandra
                        would create sticky notes.

                        <li>What are users' hesitations with hiking alone?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After conducting user interviews, we moved onto the synthesizing process.

                    <p>We used Miro to create and sticky notes from all of our interviews, which helped to sort and
                        categorize all of our interview responses.</p>

                            <p>We then read over the notes, and noticed certain patterns that we used to begin grouping
                                the responses into. This helped to visualize what were common concerns or thoughts among
                                our users, which helped us further understand what could be done to help them. </p>

                        among the average responses from men versus women. Women were less likely to feel safe hiking
                        alone and more of their concerns revolved around personal wellbeing whereas men were more
                        concerned about material possessions.
                        This research further confirmed our initial intuition to primarily have women be the target
                        demographic for our app as they definitely had more worries based on our responses.</p>

                            We began creating an "I Like... I Wish... What If..." chart of ways to potentially address

                            needs. It is important not to limit ideas during brainstorming, and just get every potential

                            prioritized for our app. As a team, we discussed each statement and narrowed it down to be
                            placed on our feature prioritization matrix.</p>

                            and ultimately solves the problem of hikers feeling unsafe or missing out on a hike due to
                            not having anyone to go with.

                            to present these features through our app. We created a user scenario, which gave us insight
                            on how someone might navigate the app.

                    <p>Now that we had a user flow, it was time to bring this to life through paper prototyping. Each
                        team member was tasked to create individual sketches based on the developed user flow. We then
                        met and laid out all of the paper prototypes into a shared Figma board, so we could discuss,
                        compare, and contrast which screens were working and which were not, to help us figure out how
                        to combine all of the most affective prototypes to move onto testing.</p>

                        <p>Trail Angel is an idea my team and I developed when we began discussing our hobbies, and
                            learned our common love of hiking but not going as often as we would like either due to
                            safety concerns of going alone, or by not having someone to go with.
                            As women who love hiking but often fear going alone for safety reasons, we all personally
                            would enjoy having an app around to help ease that anxiety.</p>
